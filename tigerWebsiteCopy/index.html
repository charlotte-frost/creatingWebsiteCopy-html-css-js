                        Here at National Geographic Kids, we love fur-ocious felines! So get ready to roar with these TEN tiger facts – they’re 
                         fierce!
                    </p>
                    <ol class="trail"> 1. Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. Adults can weigh up to 363kg – that’s about the same as ten ten year olds! – and measure up to 3.3m!</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 2. Tigers are carnivores, eating only meat. They mainly feed on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo.</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 3. Tigers are solitary hunters, and generally search for food alone at night. They quietly stalk their prey until they are close enough to pounce – then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head. Ouch!</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 4. Unlike most members of the cat family, tigers like water. They are good swimmers and often cool off in pools or streams.</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 5. When a tiger wants to be heard, you’ll know about it, gang – because their roar can be heard as far as three kilometres away.</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 6. They may be big and heavy, but tigers are by no means slow movers. In fact, at full speed they can reach up to 65km/h!</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 7. These fierce felines have walked the earth for a long time. Fossil remains of tigers found in parts of China are believed to be 2 million years lid. Yikes!</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 8. Every tiger in the world is unique – no two tigers have the same pattern of stripes.</ol>
                    <ol class="trail"> 9. Today, there are five subspecies of tiger: Bengal, South China, Indochinese, Sumatran and Siberian. Sadly, three subspecies of tiger have become extinct – Caspian, Bali and Javan.</ol>
                    <ol class="trail">10. Less than 100 years ago, tigers could be found throughout Asia. Sadly, hunting and habitat loss have put populations at risk, and today their range has been reduced to around 7% of its former size. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect these beautiful beasts!</ol>
